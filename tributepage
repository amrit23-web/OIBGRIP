<p>
Sometimes, God comes in the form of humans, and <b>Mother Mary Teresa </b>was one of such godly humans.<br><br>

She is the savior of humanity due to her selfless service to humanity.<br><br>

Mother Teresa came to India, the country of her dreams, to study and become a teacher.<br><br>

She took her final covenant on 24 May 1937 and was finally administered as the headmistress of a secondary school for the middle-class Bengali girls.<br><br>

She couldnâ€™t tolerate seeing someone in pain and was very sympathetic to them.<br><br>

Sister Teresa still owns a shrine, which is named as <b>Motherhouse of the missionaries of charity in Kolkata</b>, West Bengal.<br><br>

She is paid with respectful patronage on World youth day as well as the ministers of charity.<br><br>

Mother Teresa, at the age of 38, bid a goodbye to her sisters and religious robe exclusively for the purpose of Nursing.<br><br>

Her funeral service was conducted on 13 September 1997.<br><br>

Even today, even when she is physically absent, her prayers and guidance, along with her legacy, continue to exist.<br><br>
